Title: Research

## Rapid evolution, local adaption, and model-data connections
  My Ph.D. is focused on modelling populations that exhibit rapid responses to enviornmental change.
  Potential applications include salmon, annual plants, and infectious disease.
  I'm particularly interested in transient dynamics, connecting models to data, and forecasting.

  
##Effects of parasite exchange among farm and wild salmon


   My master's research focused on the evolutionary ecology of sea
   lice, farmed and wild salmon. I'm particularly interested in the
   ways in which the combination of wild salmon migrations and salmon
   farm management can influence chemical resistance evoultion on
   farms.
  

   Sea lice tend to proliferate on sea-cage farmed salmon, resulting
in economic costs to the farmers. These outbreaks can also affect wild
populations, which raises concerns about population conservation and
the environmental costs of sea-cage aquaculture. Salmon farmers
address these concerns with integrated pest management (IPM)
strategies that include chemical treatments. These chemicals can
reduce parasite numbers, but over time, parasites can develop a
resistance to the chemicals.

     
  In coastal B.C. new conservation regimes rely on increased use of
  chemical treatments, which is classically associated with resistance
  emergence. Achieving conservation goals could then actually
  <i>increase</i> the risk of resistance emergence; however, flow of
  susceptible genes from lice on wild fish into populations on farms
  could delay resistance emergence (similar to "refuge" planting in
  agriculture).

### Wild salmon demography

  Sustained exchange of parasites between wild and farmed salmon,
  combined with wild salmon migrations can alter dynamical patterns in
  salmon populations. Notably, patterns of line dominance in pink
  salmon may change in the presence of farms.  Line dominance can
  either increase or decrease, depending on the way in which salmon
  farms respond to infections. I published this work in _Theoretical Ecology_: 
[Aquaculture-induced changes to dynamics of a migratory host and specialist parasite: a case study of pink salmon and sea lice.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-011-0122-4)

In a follow-up study, coworkers and I show that sustained spill-back
into wild reservoir hosts can result in an Allee effect in the wild
hosts.  We published this in _The American Naturalist_:
[Allee effect from parasite spill-back.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107371)

### Parasite evolution

  
  <i>Goal</i>: Understand feedbacks between increasing chemical use,
 conservation and resistance management in the context of sea lice,
 wild salmon and salmon farms.

<i>Hypothesis</i>: Wild salmon serve as evolutionary refuges, slowing
resistance evolution in sea lice. <!--, and thus provide an
<i>ecosystem service</i>. -->

  
Questions: 

* How do wild salmon migrations near farms
  affect time to resistance emergence?
* Specifically, how do
  management actions (treatment, stocking density) affect time to
  resistance?
* What are the effects of biological assumptions?
* Related questions address synchrony of treatments on
  groups of farms in the presence of migrations.

## Support

  My Ph.D. support included a two-year traineeship with the <a
href="http://reach.ucdavis.edu/" >REACH IGERT</a>, and a one-year
Bridge RA-ship supported through the same organization.  My Master's
was supported largely by the <a href="http://www.pims.math.ca/">
Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences<a> <a
href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/igtc">International Graduate
Training Centre</a> in <a
href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/graduate-training-igtc/mathematical-biology">mathematical
biology</a>. I also received a (1 year University of Alberta Master's
Scholarship, which paid for tuition during my first term. My research
project is supported by Mark Lewis as part of an <a
href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/research1/index.htm#sls">ongoing
project on sea lice</a>.  This project is funded in part by <a
