Title: Background


In 2010 I started a PhD at <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu">UC
Davis</a> in the Population Biology Graduate Group. I'm working with
<a
href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/research.html">Marissa
Baskett</a>.  

 Prior to arriving at UC Davis I was a <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/graduate-training-igtc/mathematical-biology">PIMS
 IGTC fellow in mathematical biology</a> affiliated with the <a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mathbio">Centre for Mathematical
 Biology</a> in the <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/">Department
 of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences</a> at the <a
 href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a> After
 earning a B.Sc. in physics from Stanford University <a
 href="http://www.stanford.edu"> Stanford University</a> in 2004, I
 spent time as a consultant dealing with intellectual property in the
 San Francisco Bay area of Calfornia

## Research Interests
  
   Understanding the population ecology consequences of rapid
  evolution to changing enviornments, in particular connecting theory
  to data. 

  My Master's research focused on the ecological and evolutionary
dynamics of sea lice and salmononids with <a
href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/">Prof.  Mark Lewis</a>.
See my [research page]({filename}research).


## Funding

My Ph.D. support includes a two-year traineeship with the <a
href="http://reach.ucdavis.edu/" >REACH IGERT</a>

My M.Sc. was supported largely by the <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/"> Pacific Institute of Mathematical
 Sciences<a> <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/igtc">International Graduate
 Training Centre</a> in <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/graduate-training-igtc/mathematical-biology">mathematical
 biology</a>. I also received a (1 year) University of Alberta
 Master's Scholarship, which paid for tuition during my first term.
 My research project was also part of an <a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/research1/index.htm#sls">ongoing
 project on sea lice</a> funded in part by <a
 href="http://www.mitacs.math.ca/main.php">MITACS</a>.
