&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="doi:10.1098/rspb.2010.0707"&gt;Childs, Metcalf and Rees (2010)&lt;/a&gt; present
a plant-focused review of bet-hedging, including a review of essential
theory.  As in many papers on bet-hedging, these authors distiguish
between conservative and diversified strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Geometic mean fitness concept&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fitness is temporally variable, the appropriate measure of evolutionary success is the expected geometric mean growth rate of a genotype. This is because fitness, like population growth, is an inherently multiplicative process that is very sensitive to occasional low values. -- Childs et al 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's remind ourselves why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following roughly the notation of Frank and Slatkin (1990), let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/span&gt; the frequency of genotype &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R_i(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; the mean fitness of genotype &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; in year &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;, then
genotype frequency &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; changes as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
x_i(t+1) = \frac{R_i(t)x_i(t)}{R_1(t)x_1(t) + R_2(t)x_2(t)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Setting &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y(t) = x_1(t)/x_2(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
y(t+1)=[R_1(t)/R_2(t)]y(t)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hence, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y(t) = y(0) \prod_{i=0}^{t-1} \lambda(i)\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lambda(t) =
R_1(t)/R_2(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a (non-standard) relative fitness measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rearrange this and take logs to see &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\tfrac{1}{t} \log
(y(t)/y(0)) = \tfrac{1}{t} \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \log \lambda(i)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Applying
the law of large numbers, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E[\log \lambda(t)]\)&lt;/span&gt; determines whether
genotype 1 "wins" (i.e. expectation is &amp;gt;0) or "loses"
(i.e. expectation is &amp;lt;0).But this (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\((\prod_t
\lambda(i))^{\tfrac{1}{t}}\)&lt;/span&gt;) is the geometric mean fitness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- If so, please remind folks about the approximation of $E[\log R_1(t)]$
when $R_1(t)=1+s_i(t)$ where $s_i(t)$ has mean zero and is "small". --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;So the stochastic growth rate &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the geometric mean fitness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these are the appropriate measure of success for long-term evolution in a varying environment.
Stochastic growth rate &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rho\)&lt;/span&gt; (in Childs' notation) with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lambda(i)\)&lt;/span&gt; fitness in generation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\rho = E [ \log (\lambda(i)) ]
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which we just saw above is the geometic mean fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So how does this lead to a mean-variance tradeoff?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- The geometric mean fitness over $t$ generations
is $(\prod_n \lambda(t))^{\tfrac{1}{t}}$.  Taking the logarithm of
this, $\tfrac{1}{t} \sum_t \log(\lambda(i))$, which is $\rho$ above. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Childs et al note, Jensen's inequality here implies the geometic
mean fitness is less than the arithmetic mean &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rho \le \log
E[\lambda(i)]\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, as Sebastian mentioned last week, we can take a
Taylor approximation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
E[f(x)] \approx f( E[x]) + \tfrac{1}{2}
f''(E[x]) {\rm Var}(x).
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f = \log\)&lt;/span&gt; this gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
E[\log (\lambda)] \approx \log (E[\lambda]) - \tfrac{1}{2
E[\lambda]^2} {\rm Var}(\lambda),
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implying the magnitude of the decrease from arithmetic to geometic
mean fitness is proportional to the squared coefficient of variation
in fitness.  In fact, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lambda(i) \approx 1 + \epsilon_i\)&lt;/span&gt; with
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt; a "small" random variable with mean zero this gives the
common approximation to the stochastic growth rate &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lambda_S \approx
\bar \lambda - \tfrac{1}{2} \sigma_\lambda^2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to Slatkin's (1974) coining of &lt;em&gt;evolutionary bet-hedging&lt;/em&gt;
to denote the resulting "tradeoff" where strategies with lower
arithmetic mean fitness can invade against those with higher
arithmetic mean fitness (if they have lower variance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discussion points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is "tradeoff" a good term here? doesn't evolution just favor the maximizer of geometric mean fitness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evidence for bet hedging in nature. what is needed and what has been shown?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BH in structured populations -- IPMs are suggested as means for analyzing, what are obstacles to getting there (e.g. data limitation)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conservative versus diversified BH: how to connect this terminology to
  our framework? Any concise model of "conservative" BH?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whose fitness is it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In nature, selection often fluctuates, but observed changes in traits may owe not only to selection but plasticity. Further, changes in traits due to selection and to plasticity do not have equal demographic effects: the cost of selection is paid through declines in population number or growth rate. Thus, observed trajectories of trait value and population number can depend on interactions between plasticity, evolution and environment. The extent to which these interactions affect observed trajectories depends on the demographic context. For example, it has long been known that natural selection interacts with density-dependence, which can dilute the effect of selection on population dynamics. Although recent methods decompose observed trait change into contributions due to evolution and plasticity, these methods have not yet fully accounted for the effect of selection on demography. In particular, including information about demographic change may sharpen inference of selection versus plasticity from time series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results/Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I develop a framework to account for the joint effects of plastic and evolutionary change on population and trait dynamics. This framework focuses on the influence of selection by a seasonal environment on timing of life history events, accommodating mechanistic hypotheses concerning the form of selection. I demonstrate how the framework can be used to infer the action of plasticity and genetic evolution from time series in a case study of changes in migration timing of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="phenotypic plasticity"></category><category term="ESA2013"></category><category term="time series"></category><category term="Bayesian methods"></category><category term="phenology"></category></entry><entry><title>Allee effect from parasite spill-back</title><link href="http://ashander.github.io/posts/2013/09/allee-effect-spillback/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Martin Krkosek</name></author><id>tag:ashander.github.io,2013-09-05:posts/2013/09/allee-effect-spillback/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The exchange of native pathogens between wild and domesticated animals

of wild host-parasite systems exposed to a reservoir of domesticated

that the spill-back of native parasites from domestic to wild hosts
may cause a demographic Allee effect in the wild host population. A
second model is tailored to the particulars of pink salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis),
for which parasite spill-back is a conservation and fishery
concern. In both models, parasite spill-back weakens the coupling of
parasite and wild host abundance-particularly at low host
abundance-causing parasites per host to increase as a wild host
population declines. These findings show that parasites shared across
host populations have effects analogous to those of generalist
predators and can similarly cause an unstable equilibrium in a focal
host population that separates persistence and extirpation. Allee
effects in wildlife arising from parasite spill-back are likely to be
most pronounced in systems where the magnitude of transmission from
domestic to wild host populations is high because of high parasite
abundance in domestic hosts, prolonged sympatry of domestic and wild
hosts, a high transmission coefficient for parasites, long-lived
parasite larvae, and proximity of domesticated populations to wildlife
migration corridors.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Peer reviewed"></category><category term="M.Sc."></category><category term="Allee effect"></category><category term="spillback"></category><category term="spillover"></category><category term="salmon"></category><category term="aquaculture"></category></entry><entry><title>Trade-Offs and Synergies in Floodplain Management - A Historical-Ecological Approach</title><link href="http://ashander.github.io/posts/2012/05/trade-offs-synergies-floodplain-management-historical-ecological-poster/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-11T04:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Jaime Ashander</name></author><id>tag:ashander.github.io,2012-05-11:posts/2012/05/trade-offs-synergies-floodplain-management-historical-ecological-poster/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p style="float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 14px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 12px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; position: relative; list-style-type: none; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left; background-color: #f5f5f5; border-width: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"&gt;This poster describes our project, "Trade-Offs and Synergies in Floodplain Management - A Historical-Ecological Approach"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

concern for conservation. In the ocean, many species display life
histories that separate juveniles from adults. For pink salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus
salmonis), infection of juvenile salmon in early marine life occurs
near salmon sea-cage aquaculture sites and is associated with
declining abundance of wild salmon. Here, we develop a theoretical
model for the pink salmon/sea lice host–parasite system and use it to
explore the effects of aquaculture hosts, acting as reservoirs, on
dynamics. Because pink salmon have a 2-year lifespan, even- and
odd-year lineages breed in alternate years in a given river. These
lineages can have consistently different relative abundances, a
phenomenon termed “line dominance”. These dominance relationships
between host lineages serve as a useful probe for the dynamical
effects of introducing aquaculture hosts into this host–parasite
system. We demonstrate how parasite spillover (farm-to-wild transfer)
and spillback (wild-to-farm transfer) with aquaculture hosts can
either increase or decrease the line dominance in an affected wild
population. The direction of the effect depends on the response of
farms to wild-origin infection. If aquaculture parasites are managed
to a constant abundance, independent of the intensity of infections

   farmed and wild salmon. I'm particularly interested in the ways in
   which the combination of wild salmon migrations and salmon farm
   management can influence chemical resistance evoultion on farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea lice tend to proliferate on sea-cage farmed salmon, resulting in
economic costs to the farmers. These outbreaks can also affect wild
populations, which raises concerns about population conservation and
the environmental costs of sea-cage aquaculture. Salmon farmers
address these concerns with integrated pest management (IPM)
strategies that include chemical treatments. These chemicals can
reduce parasite numbers, but over time, parasites can develop a
resistance to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coastal B.C. new conservation regimes rely on increased use of
  chemical treatments, which is classically associated with resistance
  emergence. Achieving conservation goals could then actually
  &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the risk of resistance emergence; however, flow of
  susceptible genes from lice on wild fish into populations on farms
  could delay resistance emergence (similar to "refuge" planting in
  agriculture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wild salmon demography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustained exchange of parasites between wild and farmed salmon,
  combined with wild salmon migrations can alter dynamical patterns in
  salmon populations. Notably, patterns of line dominance in pink
  salmon may change in the presence of farms.  Line dominance can
  either increase or decrease, depending on the way in which salmon
  farms respond to infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, coworkers and I show that sustained spill-back
into wild reservoir hosts can result in an Allee effect in the wild
hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parasite evolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goal&lt;/em&gt;: Understand feedbacks between increasing chemical use,
 conservation and resistance management in the context of sea lice,
 wild salmon and salmon farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;: Wild salmon serve as evolutionary refuges, slowing
resistance evolution in sea lice. &lt;!--, and thus provide an
_ecosystem service_. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;How do wild salmon migrations near farms affect time to resistance emergence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, how do
  management actions (treatment, stocking density) affect time to
  resistance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the effects of biological assumptions?&lt;/li&gt;

this uncertainty. Because the public doesn't understand what science

&lt;p&gt;This comes from biomed world, specifically protein design, where some
awesome claims---design of protein receptors to detect TNT (the
explosive) among other things---have &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091012/full/news.2009.998.html"&gt;come under
scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;.
The lab involved &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080509/full/453275a.html"&gt;recently retracted some other
work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quotation above is from Loren Looger, who was a PhD student on the
project. He's referrring to unreported instances where a designed
protein didn't bind the target and concludes that the omission "did
not seem inappropriate." This brings up an important distinction, I
think, between negative results and experimental or procedural
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not an experimentalist, but I'll draw an analogy with
&lt;em&gt;coding&lt;/em&gt;. Let's say you're coding up a simulation for a random walk on
a one-dimensional lattice with the goal of estimating the waiting time
to reach a certain node, #N#. Let's say you don't realize there's an
exact calculation for this, but you do have some idea about the
distribution that the simulation should produce. You use that expected
distribution in debugging and error checking. Your first version
produces answers that don't fit your distributional expectations, you
find some errors and you fix them . The next version seems right. Then
you do 10,000 simulations of 2000 steps each to find the waiting time
to reach &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; (let's say N &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2000). You report the waiting time as the
average of the 10,000 runs, discarding the results of the first
version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case it seems perfectly reasonable to not discuss the errors
in getting the code right in reporting the results. The erroneous code
and the results it produced represent technical issues encountered on
the way to real, reportable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say however, you were interested in the probability that of ever
reaching &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. You should similarly report that probability as the
proportion of the 10,000 runs that &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; reached &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. If you
discarded the results that never reached &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; you would say the
probability is 1. In this case you would be omitting &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; (but
negative) &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; and mis-reporting your findings.&lt;/p&gt;

is more and more common, e.g. otoliths, feathers, shells. What can
scientists do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mainly seen biogeochemical markers used to infer relatively
static traits of individual like origin and age or to make
coarse-scale statements about diet (trophic level). The fur seal study
got trophic information at a bit finer scale (within-year variation),
connecting that to yearly migrations. This is great, but I think
really exciting work lies a little further along this path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially these markers can integrate several years of life for an
individual---recording diet and sometimes other environmental
features---in some cases they record the entire lifespan. The
combination of these integrating markers with tagging data
(effectively 'differential' markers) is especially exciting. It would
be cool to see cases where hypotheses (models) developed using one

href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/diana.lab/files/diana_2009_bioscience.pdf"&gt;BioScience&lt;/a&gt;
[1] focused on the relationship between aquaculture and
conservation. This topic is quite interesting to me, but it's
obviously subtle. I don't have well-defined thoughts except that (i)
aquaculture could theoretically relieve pressure on some wild
fisheries and (ii) certain aquaculture operations have proven negative
impacts on some ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to highlight broad trends in capture and culture
fisheries and quantify effects on biodiversity. I only skimmed it and
can't say how it does overall but one thing jumped out at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image from Diana 2009" src="http://ashander.github.io/images/sub.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, James Diana [2], describes a trend (shown in the figure
reproduced here [3]) as "market substitution". Now, the wild capture
(black dots) going down and the culture production (white dots) going
up makes for a tidy substitution story. But the figure uses
&lt;em&gt;dual-scaled&lt;/em&gt; axes (which you might &lt;a
href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/dual-scaled_axes.pdf"&gt;
never want to use &lt;/a&gt;), so the real story might look something like
the second figure (data &lt;em&gt;simulated&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; by yerstruly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Simulated data" src="http://ashander.github.io/images/rsim.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second figure makes clear that the changes in wild capture during
1980 to 200x were mere &lt;em&gt;noise&lt;/em&gt; compared to the changes in aquaculture
production. Seems like something more fundamental than simple market
substitution might underly the aquaculture growth, no? In reality, the
white dots represent growth due to the successful commoditization of
what was formely a luxury good--- wild caught salmon---essentially the
creation of a new market. (Aside: this curve is probably similar to
the curve we'd see if we plotted, starting during the late 1800's,
Pacific canned salmon production against East Coast wild capture
Atlantic production... another case where a new market was created
through commoditization.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question: what effect does the underlying market shift have on our
ability to infer market &lt;em&gt;substitution&lt;/em&gt; from production data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;refs&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a href="http://coastalvoices.blogspot.com/2009/08/last-few-days-have-seen-flurry-of.html#comment"&gt;Coastal Voices&lt;/a&gt;
 blog at Living Oceans had an intersting post up remarking on the
 disparity between Canadian's self-image as environmental progressives
 and reality---that they appeaer to lag the U.S. in marine protection
 and other conservation issues. The author wondered &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this might
 be. I left a comment, which I'll expand on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had similar thoughts and my guess is this blind spot for domestic
environmental issues owes to Canada's: (i) vast wild-lands (natural
resources), (ii) very low population and (iii) long-standing economic
dependence on extraction of those resources. Canada is simply less far
along in 'using up' its domestic natural resources, and thus less
steeped in the urgency of purpose that comes with realizing human uses
can exhuast nature's bounty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my vague understanding of history, nature's inexhaustability was
unquestioned during early European settlement and the bounty of the
Territories consistently awed settlers during westward expansion. The
gradual 'filling up' of the U.S. and concomitant loss of wilderness
and formerly abundant species eventually fostered a movement to
conserve wild lands for their own sake (or at least for the sake of
hunting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think the U.S. 'lead' on these issues owes to anything other
than our other lead---on using up our finite resources. Of course,
despite that other lead, U.S. laws aren't as strong as they might
be---in particular environmental-protection measures typically defer
to entrenched local users---so I guess both U.S. and Canadian
attitudes about conservation could use a bost.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="musing"></category><category term="Canada"></category></entry></feed>
